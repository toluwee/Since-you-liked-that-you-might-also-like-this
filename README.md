## Description

Constructed a database and ETL pipeline in SQLite to prepare message data from major natural disasters all over the world. In addition, a machine learning pipeline that uses a natural language processing (NLP) model was built to classify emergency messages based on the sender's stated need. Finally, the pipelines were used to create a website app that categorizes messages.


Key Skills Demonstrated:
* Data Modeling with SQLite
* ETL Pipeline Creation
* Machine learning Pipeline
* NLP 
* Flask Web App


This project is divided in the following key sections:

1. Processing data, building an ETL pipeline to extract data from source, clean the data and save them in a SQLite DB
2. Build a machine learning pipeline to train the which can classify text message in various categories
3. Run a web app which can show model results in real time

## Getting Started

<a name="dependencies"></a>
### Dependencies
* Python 3.5+
* Machine Learning Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Sciki-Learn
* Natural Language Process Libraries: NLTK
* SQLlite Database Libraqries: SQLalchemy
* Model Loading and Saving Library: Pickle
* Web App and Data Visualization: Flask, Plotly

<a name="installation"></a>
### Installing
To clone the git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/toluwee/Disaster_response-with-ML.git
```
<a name="execution"></a>
### Executing Program:
1. You can run the following commands in the project's directory to set up the database, train model and save the model.

    - To run ETL pipeline to clean data and store the processed data in the database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/disaster_response_db.db`
    - To run the ML pipeline that loads data from DB, trains classifier and saves the classifier as a pickle file
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/disaster_response_db.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to the http address displayed inthe terminal e.g.  http://192.168.0.85:3000/

### Additional Material

In the **data** and **models** folder you can find two jupyter notebook that will help you understand how the model works step by step:
1. **ETL Preparation Notebook**: learn everything about the implemented ETL pipeline
2. **ML Pipeline Preparation Notebook**: look at the Machine Learning Pipeline developed with NLTK and Scikit-Learn

You can use **ML Pipeline Preparation Notebook** to re-train the model or tune it through a dedicated Grid Search section.

### Important Files
**app/templates/***: templates/html files for web app

**data/process_data.py**: Extract Train Load (ETL) pipeline used for data cleaning, feature extraction, and storing data in a SQLite database

**models/train_classifier.py**: A machine learning pipeline that loads data, trains a model, and saves the trained model as a .pkl file for later use

**app.py**: This file can be used to launch the Flask web app used to classify disaster messages
